I would like to start by expressing my gratitude to my advisor Professor Tobin Driscoll. I thank you for your constant support and encouragement throughout the years. I've found your pragmatic approach to research refreshing. I especially appreciate the autonomy you've given me in my research. It has allowed me to grow into a researcher in my own right.

Thank you Professor Braun for supporting me within the tear film modeling group, in particular agreeing to fund me as a research assistant. I appreciate the encouragement you've given me to present and share my research. It has been a pleasure collaborating with you. I'd also like to thank Professor Rossi and Platte for being on my committee, and helping me revise this dissertation.

The friends I've made while finishing my dissertation have significantly enriched my life. I'd like to thank my academic sisters Amy, Lan and Rayanne. I'd especially like to thank Matt, Zach and Lan for the fun times we've shared in the math department.

I'd like to thank my family for supporting me while finishing my dissertation. My parents have helped me anytime that I have asked. I would have not pursued a PhD without their strong encouragement. It was my father that pushed me to move forward with my academic career. My siblings Emily, Scott and Mitch have been very supportive.

I especially thank Moe for the love and experiences we've shared together. I feel fortunate to have you in my life.
